# Abstract

# Introduction
Many students after finishing high school have either a vague idea about their college major or they enter college with an undeclared major. Many[@article] students change their major either after the first semester or at most after the first year they completed because they could not continue in the current major for different reasons such as they did not like the major, they could not get good GPA and/or they find it difficult for them to process with the current major. Some students change their major multiple times because they are unsure about their future goals. On the other hand, some students decide to drop out of college to work minimum wage jobs. In all these scenarios, economic factors play a pivotal role in making their decisions. While deciding their majors, there are multiple factors which most of the students fail to consider such as the employment ratio in that field, the number of job opportunities, the median pay etc. Looking at Fig 1, we see that Psychology is at the top of the list of top 10 popular majors. Based on that, it is evident that for a lot of students, Psychology is the number one choice of major in college. However, if we look at Fig 2, we can see the unemployment rates for the least ranked majors based on median salary. Out of all the majors in the list, three of the lowest ranked majors with high unemployment rates are related to Psychology, with Clinical Psychology right at the top of high unemployment list. This clearly shows and emphasizes the point that a popular major choice doesn't necessarily guarantee job security. Therefore, it is imperative to educate students about economic factors before they decide on their college majors.
